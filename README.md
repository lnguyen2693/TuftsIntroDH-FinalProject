# Overview
This is a time-aware ArcGIS map using Wikidata database to show the current location of Renaissance paintings (1300â€“1600), aiming to find out where would be the place having the most Renaissance paintings.

Since the Renaissance paintings were produced mostly in Europe, my assumption is Europe countries will have more Renaissance paintings than that of other countries. 

Due to resource limitation, this project will focus on 2 main sources of data: Wikipedia and Europeana. 

## Data preparation

### Wikipidia data

In the website [Wikidata query service](https://query.wikidata.org/), I run the following query:

```sqarql
SELECT DISTINCT ?painting ?paintingLabel ?artistLabel ?locationLabel ?locationCoord ?year ?image
WHERE {
  ?painting wdt:P31 wd:Q3305213;       # instance of painting
           wdt:P135 wd:Q4692;          # Renaissance movement
           wdt:P170 ?artist;           # creator
           wdt:P571 ?date;             # inception (date)
           wdt:P276 ?location.         # current location (e.g., museum)

  OPTIONAL { ?painting wdt:P18 ?image. }         # image
  OPTIONAL { ?location wdt:P625 ?locationCoord. } # coordinates of the museum

  BIND(YEAR(?date) AS ?year)

  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en". }
}
```

This step gives me the `data/wikidata.csv` file

### Europeana data

Fetch the [Europeana data](https://apis.europeana.eu/en) and convert data into a csv file `europeana_data.csv` using script `europeana.py`.

### Merge data

Merge two files `data/wikidata.csv` and `europeana.py` to prepare for plotting them in GIS. The goal of this step is:
- Clean up data in both `data/wikidata.csv` and `europeana.py`, make sure they all have `longitude` and `latitude` fields
- Merge 2 table to `painting_data.csv` file

Implemented in [mergeData.ipynb](./mergeData.ipynb)

## ArcGIS Map

[ArcGIS map: Renaissance painting Distribution](https://tuftsgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=c06703d01fc34af4b13159dc26c82c7e)

The map show that my assumption is correct. However, this map only showcase a very small dataset, so it can be incorrect. To my surprise is some Renaissance painting are also kept in the Asian area. This is fairly uncommon, as Asian area were colonized by the Western in the past, and it is very uncommon for the colonized to own items of its colonizer's culture, especially art, a luxury item that mainly serves the upperclass in society.

I initially wanted to make the map time-awared, which means I can slide a time slider and get more understanding about the distribution of Renaissance painting of different period. However, it seems like my data makes it impossible to do so since the feature requires a `date` data in providing all `YYYY-MM-DD`. It's impossible to obtain this kind of data about the Renaissance paintings since those paintings were produced too long ago.
